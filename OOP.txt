Encapsulation
Where: Functions like openFile(), inputSelector(), and AI_Selector().
Why: Groups related logic (file browsing, widget swapping, AI processing) into reusable blocks, hiding unnecessary details.

Polymorphism
Where: Methods like .pack() and .destroy() work across different widgets (Label, Button, Frame).
Why: Same method name, but it adapts based on the widget type.

Inheritance
Where: ttk widgets (e.g., ttk.Label, ttk.Frame) inherit from base Tkinter classes.
Why: They reuse functionality from their parent classes but add extra features like styling.

Abstraction
Where: Hugging Face pipelines (pipe = load_background_remover()) and Tkinter widgets (ttk.Combobox, ttk.Label).
Why: You don’t see how the AI model or GUI widget works internally — just a simple interface to use them.
